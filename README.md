# smart-trash-can
______________________________________________________________
Waste management is one of the vital function of a smart city. Current mechanisms do not take into account the actual fill level from containers, and instead schedule collection on predefined intervals. Since the generation of trash is dynamic in nature, it often results in some trash cans getting overloaded and leaking while other remain almost empty. An overflowing trash can be not only aesthetically unpleasant, it could also be a health hazard for communities, especially in warm environments. Did you ever find yourself wanting to adjust garbage into an overflowing trash can because the neighbor had a big party last night? Or you could not bear the nauseating smell of the trash decomposing in front of your house because the summer is unusually hot and the waste collection only happens once in 3 days? The smart trash can project is your solution!
